# Akiwrapper
Akiwrapper is a fully-documented and easy-to-use Java API wrapper for Akinator.

## Installation
#### Maven
Put this: into your pom.xml (replace LATEST_VERSION with ![central]:
```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.github.markozajc</groupId>
	<artifactId>akiwrapper</artifactId>
	<version>LATEST_VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```
You can find an example POM [here](https://github.com/markozajc/Akiwrapper/blob/master/example/pom.xml).

## Usage
It's really easy to get started with Akiwrapper. First off, we'll need to create a new Akinator API session:
```java
Akiwrapper aw = new AkiwrapperBuilder().build();
```

Now, it's time to retrieve Akinator's first question:
```java
Question q = aw.getCurrentQuestion();
```

Let's answer it with "YES":
```java
aw.answerCurrentQuestion(Answer.YES);
```
This will also return the next question

---

After repeating this process for some time (with different answers, of course), the probability of Akinator's guesses will rise to the point where it's almost certain (usually 85% is enough). You can check if there are any guesses with that probability & retrieve them with
```java
for (Guess guess : aw.getGuessesAboveProbability(0.85 /* you can specify your threshold between 0 and 1 */)) {
	// Do something with those guesses
}
```

---

There is a high chance Akinator will get at least one guess one but let's imagine the user has rejected all guesses. In this case, Akinator will run out of questions after a certain amount of answered questions. We need to watch out for this:
``` java
if (aw.answerCurrentQuestion(someAnswer) == null || aw.getCurrentQuestion() == null) {
	// Watch out! Akinator has ran out of questions! 
	// In this case,
	// - Akiwrapper#answerCurrentQuestion() will not throw an exception but rather return null no matter what
	// - Akiwrapper#getCurrentQuestion() will also keep returning null
}
```
If this happens, the best way to handle it is to let user see all guesses (no matter their probability) with iterating over `aw.getGuesses()` and asking user if this is their character on each. If they reject them all, make them feel good by telling them that they have finally defeated Akinator.

That's it! If you need more help, be sure to check an example [here](https://github.com/markozajc/Akiwrapper/tree/master/example) for an out-of-the-box working example.
